- influxdb
# The influxdb package uses `which systemctl` to decide if systemd is
# installed on the target machine. That test fails in the upstream centos
# Docker image because while systemctl(1) is installed, which(1) is not!
# Hence, we install which(1) so that check will pick the right init method.
